Shivu Chain is a simple implementation of a blockchain in JavaScript. The project is blessed by Shivu Sir himself:pray:

Project Structure  
Shivu Chain consists of three main files:

1. ```block.js``` defines the structure of a block in the blockchain. Each block contains a timestamp, data, a previous block hash, and a current block hash.
2. ```blockchain.js``` defines the structure of the blockchain, which is a linked list of blocks. It contains methods for adding new blocks to the blockchain, validating the blockchain, and printing the contents of the blockchain.
3. ```index.js``` is the main file that creates an instance of the blockchain and adds new blocks to it.

Limitations  
Please note that Shivu Chain is a basic implementation of a blockchain and is not suitable for production use. It does not have any security features or optimizations. Why do you need security when you have Shivu sirs blessing :pray:
